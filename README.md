# 🧠 Dipz Origin CLI  
### Free Tier — Structural Intelligence for Developers

Origin is a **local-first developer intelligence CLI** that scans your project, analyzes its structure, and generates an AI-readable summary — all without uploading files or sending data anywhere.

Works on any JavaScript/TypeScript project:  
**React, Next.js, Vite, Node, Express, Vue, Svelte, and more.**

Origin helps you understand your codebase in seconds — even tiny new projects.

## ⭐ Why Origin?

Developers spend too much time figuring out:

- “What’s in this project?”
- “Where are the routes?”
- “What features exist?”
- “What did I change?”
- “What should I build next?”

Origin runs a **local audit** and generates a clean summary:

```
📂 Preparing project context...
🔎 Scanning file topology...
📘 Generating Lite Summary...
✨ Lite Intelligence Activated
```

And places all insights inside:

```
docs/ai/bridge_summary.md
```

This gives you **instant clarity**, even in brand-new or tiny projects.

---

# 🚀 Quick Start

### Install globally:

```bash
npm install -g deep-origin-cli
```

Or as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm install -D deep-origin-cli
```

---

## ▶️ Run your first audit

```
origin audit
```

This will:

1. Scan your project  
2. Build a structural summary  
3. Generate `/docs/ai/bridge_summary.md`  
4. Create `/docs/audit_history/audit_xxx.json`  

Example output:

```
🧠  Origin Audit Engine — Lite Mode v1.1
📂 Preparing project context...
🔎 Scanning file topology...
📘 Generating Lite Summary...
✨ Lite Intelligence Activated
```

---

# 📁 Where Files Are Generated

```
docs/
  ai/
    bridge_summary.md   ← human-friendly insights
    bridge.json         ← lite-mode AI structure map
  audit_history/
    audit_xxx.json      ← raw structural snapshots
```

Everything stays **local**.  
Nothing is uploaded.  
Origin is private by design.
